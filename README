 ===================
 = 1. Introduction =
 ===================

I was not satisfied with any of the K Means Clustering algorithms written in C# that I could find online.
I created this library to serve as a generic K Means Clustering library, its far from perfect but it works and I will continue to update it. I plan to update this library with other machine learning algorithms written in C# as I need them.

 ====================
 = 2. Documentation =
 ====================

This project uses visual studio's built in XML documentation format.

 ==============
 = 3. Testing =
 ==============

It doesn't look like visual studio test projects are available in the express edition, which is what I'm currently using when at home. As a result I'll be moving the tests to NUnit when I get a chance. Until such time there will be no tests.

 ======================
 = 4. Version Control =
 ======================

I/We use the following workflow with git: http://reinh.com/blog/2009/03/02/a-git-workflow-for-agile-teams.html
